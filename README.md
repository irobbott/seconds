## Development Notes

### Directory
- Project lives under:  
  `http://localhost/secondspixels/` (for local development)

### Fonts
- Custom font used: `Gallery`
- Formats included: `.woff`, `.woff2`
- Defined using `@font-face` in CSS

### URL Rewriting (`.htaccess`)
- Clean URLs are implemented with Apacheâ€™s `mod_rewrite`.
- File extensions `.php` and `.html` are removed from URLs.
- `.php` or `.html` visits redirect to extensionless paths (e.g., `/home.php` âžœ `/home`).

**Important:**  
If moving from local development (`/secondspixels/`) to production (root domain), update this line in `.htaccess`:

```apache
# Local (in XAMPP)
RewriteBase /secondspixels/

# Production (live domain)
RewriteBase /
